================
Technological framework to facilitate the development of smart contracts.

**SmaC DSL**

2.Choose New -> Other -> Search by: SmaC Model in the search box -> Choose

3.Choose Smac Model's name -> Choose "File" element as the root of the model -> Ok

**Tips**
________________________
* Language Patterns:

  1. Define compiler's version.

  2. Define libraries.

  3. Define global variables.

  4. Define contracts **(At least 1).**

  5. Define local variables.

  6. Define contract's constructor(s).

  7. Define contract's modifiers.

  8. Define contract's events.

  9. Define contract's function(s).

* When defining a contract using the tool, it proposes code autocomplete suggestions using the CTRL + SPACE key combination

* Language demands a gas restriction within the loops
